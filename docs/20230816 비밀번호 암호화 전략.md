## How to store and validate password
1. Generate a long random salt using SecureRandom.
2. Use the Hash function such as SHA256 to hash both Salt and Password together.
3. Retrieve the Salt and Hash from the database.
4. Use the same Hash function

### SecureRandom
Standard JDK implementations of java.util.Random use a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) algorithm for providing random numbers. The problem with this algorithm is that itâ€™s not cryptographically strong. In other words, the generated values are much more predictable, therefore attackers could use it to compromise our system.

To overcome this issue, we should use java.security.SecureRandom in any security decisions. It produces cryptographically strong random values by using a cryptographically strong pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG).
